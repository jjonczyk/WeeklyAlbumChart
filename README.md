---------------------------------
I like statistics, programming and music so I've written this simple app just for fun.  

Requirements:  
- An account on last.fm  
_Create your account here: https://www.last.fm/_  
- Having your own API key  
_Ask for one here: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create_  

About my code:  
If you have an account already, you'll probably know that last.fm can collect ('scrobble')  
some data from streaming services like Spotify, Tidal, etc...  
You can write your `username` and `API key` into `.txt` files and specify their names in the `PATHS` dictionary.  
If you don't want to, please type your username and API key manually as you run the code.  
The app will print some basic statistics based on your favourite music from last week (using API).  

Enjoy!
