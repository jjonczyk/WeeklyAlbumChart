I like statistics, programming and music so I've made this simple app just for fun.  

Requirements:  
You need to have an account on last.fm.  

About my code:  
If you have an account already, you'll probably know that last.fm can collect ('scrobble')  
some data from streaming services like Spotify, Tidal, etc...  
As you run this code, all you need to do is type your username  
and the app will print some basic statistics based on your favourite music from last week (using API).  

Enjoy!
